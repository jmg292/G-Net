G-Net a peer-to-peer virtual private network that is:

* Free, private, and secure by default
* Decentralized and distributed
* Low maintenance
* Easy to deploy 

It draws inspiration from a number of similar projects, including:

* [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/)
* [Netmaker](https://www.netmaker.org/)
* [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/)
* And more

G-Net was designed to bring zero trust network access to SOHO networks without introducing a third party or any centralized infrastructure.  Device identities are created using coprocessors such as the [TPM](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/tpm-library-specification/), and user identities are created using PIV-capable security tokens such as the [Yubikey](https://www.yubico.com/). 

This project is not yet ready for release.  Code is available in the development branch. 

Technical documentation is made available in the [Wiki](https://github.com/jmg292/G-Net/wiki) as this project develops.
