# G-Net: A Zero Trust Virtual Private Network

G-Net is a zero trust remote access and administration utility that is:

* Free, private, and secure by default
* Scalable, but primarily designed for personal use
* Fully decentralized and distributed
* Built using existing security concepts and technologies
* Powerful, but easy to maintain

This project is not yet ready for release.  Code is available in the development branch. 

Technical documentation is made available in the [Wiki](https://github.com/jmg292/G-Net/wiki) as this project develops.

## Motivation

G-Net was inspired while familiarizing myself with the "zero trust" design paradigm.  

Many of the tools in this space are closed source, proprietary, and extremely expensive.  They tend to rely heavily on centralized infrastructure, which can introduce a single point of failure into customer networks. The process of deploying these tools often requires networked endpoints to blindly trust one or more external entities.  Such a trust relationship is not inherently dangerous, but it certainly stretches the literal definition of the words "zero trust."

I wanted to design a less centralized approach to zero trust network architecture. This project implements that design within a tool that is useful in my everyday life.
