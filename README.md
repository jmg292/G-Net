# Peer-to-Peer Distributed, Decentralized Zero Trust Toolkit

![CodeQL Analysis](https://github.com/jmg292/G-Net/actions/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml/badge.svg)

Once upon a time I set out to build a VR-native, Windows-based, bare metal malware analysis lab capable of:

1. Dynamically generating a force-directed, 3D Virtual Reality node map of every device on my network
2. Viewing a device's IP address and hostname by highlighting its corresponding node
3. Authenticating with a device and negotiating a secure connection by clicking on its corresponding node
4. Executing malicious binaries on a remote, bare-metal Windows box
5. Capturing any and all network traffic going to and from that device for later analysis
6. Capturing any and all unauthorized changes to that device for later analysis
7. Viewing the captured information in 3D Virtual Reality
8. Performing static binary analysis in 3D virtual reality

I quickly learned one simple truth: before a person is able to build a new type of tool, they have to solve a whole bunch of brand new types of problems.  The first problem I had to solve can be seen below (the gif is big and ~30 seconds long, but it's worth it):

_It's a really bad idea to integrate a filesystem with a physics engine_

## Research Foundation

I learned a _ton_ while I was working on G-Net's design, specifically in the areas of:

* Windows Security
* Network Security
* Infrastructure Security
* Peer-to-peer networking
* Virtual private networking
* Mobile Device Management
* Cryptographic coprocessors and security tokens

### Exploratory Projects

I haven't just spent all my time on research!  Over the years I've tinkered with a few other projects to understand the various technologies that would be involved in this effort to achieve my cyberpunk dreams.

* [PyArmoryCtl](https://github.com/jmg292/pyarmoryctl): Learning more about [Bluetooth's multipoint mesh](https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/recent-enhancements/mesh/mesh-faq/) by tinkering with the [ANNA-B112](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/anna-b112-open-cpu)'s AT interface
* [wumbo-scale (alternately: JeffScale)](https://github.com/jmg292/wumbo-scale): A deep dive into [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) - A zero-configuration peer-to-peer VPN built on Wireguard
* [G-Net Citadel](https://github.com/jmg292/G-Net_Archive/tree/main/CitadelNetworkManager): My first crack at building a peer-to-peer VPN on top of Wireguard

### Previous work

Some of G-Net's design is inspired by unrelated development projects written earlier in my career.

* [TORComm](https://github.com/jmg292/TORComm): Learning more about the TOR network by re-implementing its protocol from scratch
* [PyArmory](https://github.com/jmg292/PyArmory): Exploring the various communications protocols available on the [USB Armory Mk. 2](https://github.com/usbarmory/usbarmory)

## Design Overview

G-Net's design covers the G-Net framework itself, as well as a number of tools designed to leverage that toolkit. Every G-Net component is designed to be:

* Distributed & Decentralized
* Fully auditable
* Easy to Use
* Low maintenance
* Open & Compatible

An overview of each of these components is available in this section.

### A Zero Trust Security Framework

I didn't actually set out to get involved in the "Zero Trust" game at all. G-Net's security framework was designed as a means of:

* Auditing network traffic to and from my malware analysis lab
* Restricting the destination of network traffic eminating from a specific origin
* Irrefutably guaranteeing the origin of network traffic using a devices' TPM
* Authorizing network sessions using a devices' TPM

Searching for related work led me to [Google's BeyondCorp](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/43231.pdf) implementation, which ultimately led me to [NIST.SP.800-207 - Zero Trust](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf). I was pleasantly surprised to find an industry standard solution to my specific problems and decided to adopt ZTNA tenets as a part of this project.

### Identity & Access Management

I thoroughly evaluated every IDP, PDP, and VPN available to me during the research phase of this project. During this evaluation I was unable to find simple way to identify and authenticate devices using a TPM.  All of the products I evaluated:

1. Either required a _ton_ of additional PKI to enable certificate-based authentication (see: [Okta Device Trust](https://help.okta.com/en-us/Content/Topics/Mobile/Okta_Mobile_Device_Trust_Windows-desktop.htm)), or
2. Offered no support for the TPM at all

[StrongSwan](https://www.strongswan.org/) is a notable exception.  It's an open source VPN solution that can be configured to use TPMs and smart cards for authentication, but is unable to support the introspection and discovery aspects of my project without significant modification.  The level of effort required to modify StrongSwan was about the same as the level of effort required to build an IDP.

I decided to build my own identity engine - one with a bit more flexibility.

#### Network Blockchain

At its heart, the G-Net uses a Proof of Authority blockchain (called a [Tracery](https://github.com/jmg292/G-Net/wiki/Traceries:-The-Network-Configuration-Blockchain)) as an identity database.  Other components use the Tracery for domain configuration, device management, authorization, and access control. The Tracery is a core component of G-Net.  

Incorporating the Tracery into the design allows G-Net to store a full, tamper-proof copy of its database on every node in a network. Traceries provide strong guarantees of integrity and non-repudiation, allowing authoritative services to store their databases on user-owned endpoint devices without any concern of unauthorized modification. 

Since the database is stored locally, G-Net nodes provide their own authoritative IDP and PDP services. Additionally, any and every node is allowed (even encouraged!) to host its own authoritative directory server, domain controller, and certificate authority. These services are logically federated under a single domain and securely managed by a central Network Authority.

This is only possible thanks to a PoA blockchain's natural tamper-resistance. Modifying a locally stored copy of the Tracery without delegated authority from the network's Founder will cause validation checks to _fail_. G-Net's core network services will cease to function if an invalid Tracery is detected, preventing the node from communicating with the rest of the network (unless the unauthorized modification can be reverted).

The Tracery's fail-secure tamper detection allowed me to design some pretty cool functionality, including: Device Management, Network Configuration, Directory Services and a full-blown Windows Active Directory Domain Controller. To reiterate: 

> Each node is capable of serving as its own fully privileged, centrally managed, federated Active Directory Domain Controller. 

And:

> Even in this configuration, a node is unable to make changes to the domain without authorization from a central Network Authority.

That opens up some pretty neat policy options for airgapped devices.

#### Distributed Identity Platform

G-Net's dIDP is designed to provide the identity verification and authentication functionality required to adopt the "Tenets of Zero Trust" described in [NIST.SP.800-207](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf). It mandates the use of security tokens (such as the Yubikey) or commodity HSMs (such as the TPM) for:

* [[NIST.FIPS.201-3]](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.201-3.pdf) - Secure, reliable identification of users and devices
* Device identity verification and authentication
* PIV-compatible X509 certificate storage and management
* Certificate Authority operations related to PIV-compatible X509 certificate storage and management

An network administrator can use the dIDP to:

* Build and manage a directory of authorized users and device identities (Directory services)
* Provide cryptographically verifiable guarantees about managed identities (Attestation, Non-repudiation)
* Assign and manage permissions associated with managed identities (Access management)

The dIDP provides a message bus interface to other components.  This allows G-Net to integrate its identity database with existing services to support standard protocols (such as LDAP and OIDC).

### Virtual Private Networking

G-Net's VPN exists as a byproduct of the network and routing services available to and offered by participants (or nodes) in G-Net's peer-to-peer network. Nodes leverage NAT traversal capabilities and packet relays to communicate directly without knowledge of the underlying physical infrastructure. G-Net uses these logical data-links to organize nodes into a loosely defined mesh topology.

If you'd like to learn more about G-Net's VPN design, see: [Networking: Topology, Routing, and Packet Delivery](https://github.com/jmg292/G-Net/wiki/Networking:-Topology,-Routing,-and-Packet-Delivery)

### Transparency & Auditability

G-Net's [core design philosophies](https://github.com/jmg292/G-Net/wiki/Design-Philosophies/5bd3c88cfe156c24f1a48c59e0f57068959bd569) have _always_ involved the two fundamental beliefs that:

* A device's owner should always have a say in its configuration
* Identities should be permanent, immutable, and cryptographically verifiable

G-Net is able to guarantee _complete Transparency and Auditability_ of a node's _locally stored configuration_ by combining these two philosophies in the form of a [Tracery](https://github.com/jmg292/G-Net/wiki/Traceries:-The-Network-Configuration-Blockchain). This is [briefly described in the existing article](https://github.com/jmg292/G-Net/wiki/WUMBO-Format-Overview):

> WUMBO is designed with security in mind. The authenticity, integrity, and origin of each WUMBO'd packet is cryptographically guaranteed, and that guarantee can be verified by any node in a G-Net network. Additionally, a WUMBO'd packet will fail verification if it's processed out of sequence, which protects against accidental misconfiguration.

> WUMBO formatting prevents unauthorized modification of a G-Net network's configuration by linking the integrity of each control packet to the integrity of control packet before it. Additionally, the process of WUMBO-ing a packet requires the packet to be signed by an authorized network administrator. This creates a fully transparent change management process by creating a public, irrevocable link between a network administrator and the configuration changes that they implement.

A deep dive into the way these link together is available in a new Wiki titled [Transparency & Auditability: A Functional Overview](https://github.com/jmg292/G-Net/wiki/Transparency-&-Auditability:-A-Functional-Overview).  This article combines [existing](https://github.com/jmg292/G-Net/wiki/WUMBO-Format-Overview) [specification](https://github.com/jmg292/G-Net/wiki/Format-Specification---Warrant-&-Update-Management-Block-Object) documentation to illustrate how _G-Net's Transparency & Immutability_ are _cryptographically verifiable byproducts_ derived by _each node individually_ through the simple act of _loading its locally stored configuration_ from a Tracery.

### Additional Components

The project is under active development, with a few additional G-Net components still stuck in the design phase.

The project roadmap, planned development, and overall progress are available within [G-Net's Project Page](https://github.com/users/jmg292/projects/1)
